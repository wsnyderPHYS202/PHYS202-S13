Both functions run throught the positions of the cars staring to the lowest to the higest, measure the distance to the next car, and then apply the rules set out. When it reaches the last car, it measures the distance to the next car as the distance to the first car. Once all of the cars have had their velocities set, they all move simultaneously. Also, when a car goes farther than the road length, it cycles back to the beginning.\n",
